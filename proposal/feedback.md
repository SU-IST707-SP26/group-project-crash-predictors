Very good!  This is a really nice report.  You've understood the problem well and I think you have a decent plan.  However, I've a two recommendations:

1 - You should pick one stakeholder and focus on their needs.  I've it's a traffic planner, you'll want to try to isolate feature importance so that policy makers know what to do.  If it EMS, you'll want to give them forecasting models so that they can make sure to adjust staff and plan routes (perhaps even pre-position service vehicles).  You could imagine an extension for logistics planning - where should I garage my emergency vehicles to reduce transit time? Having a well-defined stakeholder will really enhance what you deliver in the end.  Think through each of your identified stakeholders, and then push yourself to think about what they *really* need.

2 - You may want to explore explicitly temporal models - LSTMs in particular.  You could even imagine a CNN for spatial modeling and LSTM for temporal modeling, chained together.  

As we move through the semester, you'll be exposed to different sorts of models, and so you'll have more tools at your disposal.  But chances are (if you decide longitudinal modeling is important) you'll need to get going on this earlier rather than later.

Please reach out as you begin to encounter questions.  Happy to provide guidance and feedback.

SCORE: 5/5
